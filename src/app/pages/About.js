            Hey there, I{`'`}m <b>Michelle Chen</b>!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a <b>full-stack developer</b> with a passion for crafting
            innovative solutions. Graduating from the University of British
            Columbia with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I{`'`}ve
            honed my coding and problem-solving skills, ready to tackle any
            challenge that comes my way.

        <p>
          My journey into technology began with a desire to explore and make a
          positive impact in human life. I aimed to develop coding projects that
          can help others make their lives easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond tech, I find joy in simple pleasures. Whether it{`'`}s losing
          myself in music üéß, hitting the ski slopes ‚õ∑Ô∏è, or busting out some
          K-pop dance moves üíÉ, I{`'`}m always up for new adventures.
